 Class BufferedReader

     +--java.io.Reader

	             +--java.io.BufferedReader
		     Direct Known Subclasses:
		     LineNumberReader
		     public class BufferedReader
		     extends Reader
		     Read text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines.

		     The buffer size may be specified, or the default size may be used. The default is large enough for most purposes.

		     In general, each read request made of a Reader causes a corresponding read request to be made of the underlying character or byte stream. It is therefore advisable to wrap a BufferedReader around any Reader whose read() operations may be costly, such as FileReaders and InputStreamReaders. For example,

		      BufferedReader in
		         = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("foo.in"));
			  
			  will buffer the input from the specified file. Without buffering, each invocation of read() or readLine() could cause bytes to be read from the file, converted into characters, and then returned, which can be very inefficient.
			  Programs that use DataInputStreams for textual input can be localized by replacing each DataInputStream with an appropriate BufferedReader.

			  JDK1.1

																		      BufferedReader

																		      public BufferedReader(Reader in,
																		                            int sz)
																					    Create a buffering character-input stream that uses an input buffer of the specified size.
																					    Parameters:
																					    in - A Reader
																					    sz - Input-buffer size
																					    Throws:
																					    IllegalArgumentException - If sz is <= 0
																					    BufferedReader

																					    public BufferedReader(Reader in)
																					    Create a buffering character-input stream that uses a default-sized input buffer.
																					    Parameters:
																					    in - A Reader
																					    Method Detail
																					    read

																					    public int read()
																					             throws IOException
																						     Read a single character.
																						     Overrides:
																						     read in class Reader
																						     Throws:
																						     IOException - If an I/O error occurs
																						     read

																						     public int read(char[] cbuf,
																						                     int off,
																								                     int len)
																										              throws IOException
																											      Read characters into a portion of an array.
																											      This method implements the general contract of the corresponding read method of the Reader class. As an additional convenience, it attempts to read as many characters as possible by repeatedly invoking the read method of the underlying stream. This iterated read continues until one of the following conditions becomes true:

																											      The specified number of characters have been read,
																											      The read method of the underlying stream returns -1, indicating end-of-file, or
																											      The ready method of the underlying stream returns false, indicating that further input requests would block.
																											      If the first read on the underlying stream returns -1 to indicate end-of-file then this method returns -1. Otherwise this method returns the number of characters actually read.
																											      Subclasses of this class are encouraged, but not required, to attempt to read as many characters as possible in the same fashion.

																											      Ordinarily this method takes characters from this stream's character buffer, filling it from the underlying stream as necessary. If, however, the buffer is empty, the mark is not valid, and the requested length is at least as large as the buffer, then this method will read characters directly from the underlying stream into the given array. Thus redundant BufferedReaders will not copy data unnecessarily.

																											      Overrides:
																											      read in class Reader
																											      Parameters:
																											      cbuf - Destination buffer
																											      off - Offset at which to start storing characters
																											      len - Maximum number of characters to read
																											      Returns:
																											      The number of characters read, or -1 if the end of the stream has been reached
																											      Throws:
																											      IOException - If an I/O error occurs
																											      readLine

																											      public String readLine()
																											                      throws IOException
																													      Read a line of text. A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed ('\n'), a carriage return ('\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a linefeed.
																													      Returns:
																													      A String containing the contents of the line, not including any line-termination characters, or null if the end of the stream has been reached
																													      Throws:
																													      IOException - If an I/O error occurs
																													      skip

																													      public long skip(long n)
																													                throws IOException
																															Skip characters.
																															Overrides:
																															skip in class Reader
																															Parameters:
																															n - The number of characters to skip
																															Returns:
																															The number of characters actually skipped
																															Throws:
																															IllegalArgumentException - If n is negative.
																															IOException - If an I/O error occurs
																															ready

																															public boolean ready()
																															              throws IOException
																																      Tell whether this stream is ready to be read. A buffered character stream is ready if the buffer is not empty, or if the underlying character stream is ready.
																																      Overrides:
																																      ready in class Reader
																																      Throws:
																																      IOException - If an I/O error occurs
																																      markSupported

																																      public boolean markSupported()
																																      Tell whether this stream supports the mark() operation, which it does.
																																      Overrides:
																																      markSupported in class Reader
																																      Following copied from class: java.io.Reader
																																      Returns:
																																      true if and only if this stream supports the mark operation.
																																      mark

																																      public void mark(int readAheadLimit)
																																                throws IOException
																																		Mark the present position in the stream. Subsequent calls to reset() will attempt to reposition the stream to this point.
																																		Overrides:
																																		mark in class Reader
																																		Parameters:
																																		readAheadLimit - Limit on the number of characters that may be read while still preserving the mark. After reading this many characters, attempting to reset the stream may fail. A limit value larger than the size of the input buffer will cause a new buffer to be allocated whose size is no smaller than limit. Therefore large values should be used with care.
																																		Throws:
																																		IllegalArgumentException - If readAheadLimit is < 0
																																		IOException - If an I/O error occurs
																																		reset

																																		public void reset()
																																		           throws IOException
																																			   Reset the stream to the most recent mark.
																																			   Overrides:
																																			   reset in class Reader
																																			   Throws:
																																			   IOException - If the stream has never been marked, or if the mark has been invalidated
																																			   close

																																			   public void close()
																																			              throws IOException
																																				      Close the stream.
																																				      Overrides:
																																				      close in class Reader
																																				      Throws:

How to Read File in Java	 
User Rating: / 1192 
PoorBest 
This code will read the MyFile.txt and print its content on the console. It reads the file line by line in the form of DataInputStream.

package MyProject

import java.io.BufferedInputStream;
import java.io.DataInputStream;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.IOException;

/**
 * This program reads a text file line by line and print to the console. It uses
 * FileOutputStream to read the file.
 * 
 */
public class FileInput {

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    File file = new File("C:\\MyFile.txt");
    FileInputStream fis = null;
    BufferedInputStream bis = null;
    DataInputStream dis = null;

    try {
      fis = new FileInputStream(file);

      // Here BufferedInputStream is added for fast reading.
      bis = new BufferedInputStream(fis);
      dis = new DataInputStream(bis);

      // dis.available() returns 0 if the file does not have more lines.
      while (dis.available() != 0) {

      // this statement reads the line from the file and print it to
        // the console.
        System.out.println(dis.readLine());
      }

      // dispose all the resources after using them.
      fis.close();
      bis.close();
      dis.close();

    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    } catch (IOException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}

Parsing input from console on the fly with Scanner    
Jan 29, 2010 12:05 AM 
  

  

 
So I ma playing around with Java again, writing the majority of one of my projects for school computing transitive closure of a relation using arrays... fun stuff. I decide I want to learn something new since I glossed over delimiters when beginning java.
I want my user to be able to enter a pair of data (2,3) into java and terminate with a carriage return. Only problem is because of my utter lack of information of delimiters and scanner class (poor textbook coverage), I am left to try and fiddle with it and have managed 
to get only the first and second element entered (2,3) assigned to int a and int b via keyboard.useDelimiter(","). Code snippet is attached.

Alright, so after all this long wind what is my question. How do I use delimiters to parse input from the console such that I can enter data into the program as 2,3 1,2 3,4 4,3 and terminate using some nifty code after entering a carriage return? Maybe I just get myself into these things and should just get the program to run easy mode and be done but I can't keep from learning something new. Please help!

keyboard.useDelimiter(", ");

a = keyboard.nextInt();
b = keyboard.nextInt();

System.out.println("a = " a " b = " +b);

Please use CODE TAGS to highlight your code next time.

If you would like to split input based upon a delimiter, the first thing you need to do is read in a line of input, preferably into a String for processing. From here you can use the split method of String to split for example "2,3" into an array of Strings containing the set ["2", "3"] using the delimiter ','.

Melanie, thank you for your reply. I apologize for not using code tags, I am new to this forum.
So ok, I my set of numbers read and I am beginning to think that perhaps this is the only way to do this?
I understand how split() works but my question in why can I not simply use input delimiter on the console for reading 
input in?

Is it possible to use delimiter on console input directly form the keyboard for a string of inputs delimited directly at the keyboard?

Yes definitely, if you are using a Scanner then you can set the delimiter via the setDelimiter() method. Refer the the API for Scanner for more information.

Ok, I got it partially working but scanner is not acting properly and not reading in 1 pieces of my data ( pair of comma and white space separated numbers (2, 3)

Perhaps you can offer my pointers and suggestions.

 Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in).useDelimiter(",\\s* ");
                 
          for (i = 0; i <=5; i++)
        {
            a = keyboard.nextInt();
            b =keyboard.nextInt();
            System.out.println("a = " + a + " b = " + b);
            x[a][b] = 1;
 
        }


If I use as input 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 4, 2, 4, 5 the scanner hangs on the last 2 (4, 5)

Do you notice your program continues to run when the output is complete or in fact incomplete? This is because the Scanner is waiting for the delimiter to pass the set of numbers.

I changed the delimiter to incorporate the newline and return characters and it seems to work as intended.

"(,\\s* )|\r\n"

Well cause I am a dummy mel and why I come here to have someone else write my programs. In all seriousness, this is a rather old, boring, but new topic for me because I only did what I was asked to do in COSC 111 ... use scanner to spit out something for a grade. I suppose now that I want to do something usefull, I need to delve further. If you know a place for noobs like me with loads of info on stuff just washed over by profs and textbooks especially, ESPECIALLY delimiters cause my book has a list like 6 long I would appreciate it and thank you for the help.

I'm not sure if I'm meant to greet this with open arms or a sword and shield. In other words I have no idea what you just said, semi sounded like an attack, but who knows.

You are on the internet my friend, the biggest library in the universe. Google is an excellent search engine, try typing in some queries, I'm sure you will find enough to read for a lifetime.

Honest regarding the fact that most textbooks in computer science claiming to introduce, educate, and inform students in an "Absolute" fashion, if you get my reference or not (Savitch), tend to gloss with a high degree of superfluity most of the nature of the language while incorporating as much fluff and slush that you get, as my professor put it, a text book that does non-stop talking about nothing while missing the fact that covering delimiters and parsing input form the scanner is a topic of interest at a most basic level.

So why do i come to a forum to have Melanie Green instruct me when I paid over $100 bucks for a book? I don't know and all I can say is thank you for your help while realizing that perhaps education today is truly all about self-educating while paying someone else to write on a board or buy a book that is so poor at teaching the basics of the language that I need the internet, a free resource, while paying for my education.

That was perhaps more of a rant from times past when things were different, much different. Anyway, I hope this explains my position and was not intended or to be interpreted as an attack on someone I dialogued with to help me fancy up my program.
